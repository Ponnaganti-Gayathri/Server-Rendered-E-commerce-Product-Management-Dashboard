# Server-Rendered E-commerce Product Management Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Server-Side Rendered (SSR) E-commerce Product Management Dashboard** designed for administrators to efficiently manage products in an e-commerce system.  
It leverages **server-side rendering** to ensure fast page load times, better SEO, and reliable data delivery while providing a modern, interactive admin experience.

The dashboard allows admins to **create, view, update, and delete products**, upload product images securely, visualize sales and stock data through charts, and manage access via authentication and authorization.
